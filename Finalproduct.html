              Allow me to reintroduce myself: I am Rose-Elizabeth Chika Karlay,
              my mother's second daughter and my father's fourth child. I spent
              my childhood in Liberia, where I was resided by my father and
              stepmother, Blatu, and numerous cousins until I was seven years
              old. Contrary to the stereotype, Blatu was far from the wicked
              stepmother depicted in Cinderella. She was a mother and a friend
              to me. Eventually, I began spending more time at my biological
              mother's home, where I discovered I had two additional sisters: my
              older sister, Victoria, and my younger sister, Gloria.

            <h3>My Adolescence</h3>
            <p>
              At age 11, in 2017, my mother got a scholarship to study in
              Germany and took my little sister and me along. During the
              Lockdown in 2020, my mother believed it would be best for us to
              stay in Germany, even after her graduation. Knowing that decision,
              I studied hard to be fluent in the language, both in writing and
              speaking, made lifelong friends, and finished my
              Realschulabschluss with a 1.8-grade point average. As of today, I
              am pursuing my Fachabitur in computer science, nearing the
              completion of my first year of the two-year program.

            <p>
              In 3rd to 5th grade, I thrived in the drama club, sparking my love
              for performing and storytelling. When I moved to Germany and
              enrolled at Friedrich-Erbert-Schule, I repeated 5th grade to catch
              up with the language, putting me a year behind. To improve my
              German, I attended DaZ classes several times a week throughout 5th
              and 6th grades. Despite the language hurdle, my subjects were
              similar to those back home, just taught in German.

            <p>
              Transitioning to high school within the same institution, my
              proficiency in the German language flourished. Gradually, my
              reliance on DaZ classes diminished as I integrated more
              effectively into mainstream education, earning grades alongside
              native German students. Throughout my high school tenure, I
              consistently excelled academically, proudly identifying as a
              RealschulschÃ¼lerin.

              At my technical Fachschule, my academic focus narrowed primarily
              to Informatics, aligning with my passion for the subject.
              Nonetheless, my curriculum retains a well-rounded approach,
              encompassing disciplines such as English, Economics, German,
              Sports, and Ethics.
